            <p>
            Utilidata is a Providence-based software analytics company (>30 employees) focused on modernizing the electric grid. For
            nearly decade, we’ve partnered with many of the largest utilities in the US to optimize power delivery through real-time
            coordinated control of grid operators’ critical equipment. With Utilidata’s Volt/VAR Optimization (VVO) software, utilities
            gain powerful visibility into their operations while driving significant customer cost savings and energy efficiency. Utilidata
            is the market leader for this technology, which the Environmental Defense Fund <a href="http://blogs.edf.org/energyexchange/files/2016/03/Voltage-Optimization-Fact-Sheet-Nov-2015.pdf">describes</a> as <i>“one of the lowest of the low-hanging
            fruits that could accelerate the transition to a clean energy economy”</i>.
            </p>
            <p>
              The convergence of several global trends in energy and transportation is increasing the need for powerful grid analytics
              and control software:
              <ul>
                <li class="list_item">
                  Distributed energy resources (DERs): A growing number of rooftop solar panels, distributed wind turbines, fuel cells, and
                  batteries are upending the traditional grid model (i.e., large central power plants, one-way power flows) and demanding new
                  software tools.

                <li class="list_item">
                  Electric vehicles (EVs): Current projections for US EV sales in the coming decade far exceed what our grid infrastructure
                  can support. Utilities require novel analytics capabilities to ensure continued grid stability and reliability even as EVs
                  proliferate.

                  Cyber-physical security: Increasingly networked power infrastructure represents a uniquely vulnerable target for cyber attackers,

                  crucial elements of utilities’ cyber defense.
